  The journey of <span className="font-bold">Comments Fusion</span> began with a personal challenge. As a seasoned marketer and
  founder of a successful digital agency <span className="font-bold">Konquer Solutions Pvt.Ltd.</span>, 
  <span className="font-bold">Murad Butt</span> found it increasingly difficult to engage meaningfully with prospects on 
  <span className="font-bold">LinkedIn</span>. Despite having strong services and a credible profile, generating conversations 
  that led to real business opportunities was both time consuming and ineffective through traditional methods like cold outreach 
  or generic comments. <span className="font-bold">Murad</span> realized this wasn’t just his problem — it was a widespread gap 
  in the digital networking process. Business owners and professionals were struggling to turn passive online presence into active 
  lead generation. Out of this frustration came inspiration.
